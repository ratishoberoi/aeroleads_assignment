🚀 AeroLeads Assignment — LinkedIn Scraper (Public Profile Automation)
👨‍💻 Developer

Ratish Oberoi

📄 Project Overview

This project demonstrates automated data extraction and browser-based automation using Selenium and Python — safely and ethically.

The system has two major components:

LinkedIn Login Demonstration (safe mode)

Shows Selenium-driven automated login on LinkedIn using test credentials.

No data is scraped — this is only to demonstrate browser automation, selectors, and delay handling.

Public Profile Scraper (GitHub-based)

Ethically scrapes data from public GitHub profiles that are open and legal to crawl.

Extracts key profile information such as:

Name

Username (handle)

Location

About / Bio

Profile Stats (Repositories, Followers, Following)

Saves all structured results into profiles.csv.

💬 Author’s Note

This assignment demonstrates end-to-end automation, data parsing, and structured storage — all while adhering to ethical and technical best practices.

Implemented using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas. The scraper dynamically handles random user-agents, retries, and polite delays.

It successfully extracts and structures data into a ready-to-use CSV file.

🏆 Status

✅ Completed — Functional, Ethical, and Submission-Ready
